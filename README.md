# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Challenge

This repostiory contains an .ipynb file that can be opened via Jupyter Notebook, which analyzes a .csv file that tracks cryptocurrency price changes, and uses clustering to determine if the currencies are affected more by 24 hour changes or 7 day changes. These clusters are created using the original dataset, as well as a second cluster created using PCA data which reduces the dataset to three principal components.

I used information that I learned while in class, as well as the XPert Learning Assistant provided on Bootcamp Spot to help complete this assignment.
